Hi, I'm David Huang, an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. I'm applying to PhD programs in the fall of 2025, with a broad interest in advancing research at the intersection of AI security, alignment, and large-scale machine learning systems.

My research focuses on addressing security vulnerabilities and adversarial robustness challenges in large language models (LLMs). Recently, I have worked on developing universal and transferable jailbreaking attacks to expose model vulnerabilities while simultaneously exploring preference learning techniques to enhance alignment and robustness. My efforts also aim to establish theoretical guarantees for these approaches.

In the past, I have contributed to transfer defenses in computer vision models and optimized data management systems to improve transformer training efficiency.

Currently, I am a researcher at Berkeley's Artificial Intelligence Lab (BAIR), where I have had the privilege of collaborating with outstanding mentors such as Chawin Sitawarin and Julien Piet under Professor David Wagner on projects related to computer security and AI applications. Additionally, I have explored AI alignment under the guidance of Professors Song Mei and Dawn Song and worked on robotics and AI systems research with Professor Ken Goldberg.
