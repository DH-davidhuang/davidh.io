Hi, I'm David Huang, an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science. I'm an incoming PhD @ Princeton. My research lies at the intersection of AI security, alignment, and large-scale machine learning systems. If you'd like to connect or discuss related topics, feel free to reach out at huang33176 [at] berkeley [dot] edu.

My previous work has put some focus on tackling security vulnerabilities and improving the adversarial robustness of large language models (LLMs). I have developed universal and transferable jailbreaking techniques to uncover model weaknesses while concurrently exploring preference learning methods to enhance alignment and resilience. My efforts also aim to combine empirical findings with theoretical guarantees to build more secure and reliable AI systems. 

I have also contributed to open-source data management toolkits designed to optimize data pipelines and enhance the training efficiency of transformer models.

In the past, I have also dabbled in transfer defenses for computer vision models!

Currently, I am a researcher at Berkeley's Artificial Intelligence Lab (BAIR), where I have had the privilege of working with the guidance of outstanding mentors such as [Chawin Sitawarin](https://chawins.github.io/) and [Julien Piet](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~julien.piet/) under [Professor David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/) on projects related to computer security and AI applications. Additionally, I have explored AI alignment under the guidance of [Professors Song Mei](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~songmei/) and [Professor Dawn Song](https://dawnsong.io/) and worked on robotics and AI systems research with [Professor Ken Goldberg](https://goldberg.berkeley.edu/).
