Hi, I’m a first-year PhD student at Princeton. My research focuses on the intersection of AI security and safety, with a particular interest in strengthening model robustness and privacy against adversarial threats. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Prateek Mittal](https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/). I also collaborate with Gray Swan AI. 

Previously, I was an CS undergraduate at UC Berkeley, where I worked in Berkeley's Artificial Intelligence (BAIR) Lab. I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/) and [Chawin Sitawarin](https://chawins.github.io/) on projects at the intersection of AI security and model robustness.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
